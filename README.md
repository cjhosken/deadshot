## Development

Make sure to work in a virtual environment!
`python3 -m venv .venv`
Then activate it.
`source .venv/bin/activate` or `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate`


`npm run install:all` installs all requirements.

`npm run dev` runs the development environment.

`npm run build` will build the app for release.
